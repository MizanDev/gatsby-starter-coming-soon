# gatsby-starter-coming-soon

## What Is This?

A starter project for building a coming soon page with minimum configuration. The aim is to have a starter project for Gatsby which you can adopt by just editing a simple text file and then push the site to a web hosting service.

Certainly you can use the starter to build upon it and adjust it to your needs.

A tutorial on how to install, launch, and develop it further will follow soon. See the roadmap below.
